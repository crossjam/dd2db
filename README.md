# dd2db: Discogs datasets 2 database

A recasting of code from
[discogs-xml2db](https://github.com/philipmat/discogs-xml2db) code for
the modern era.

An CLI toolkit oriented around taking the [Discogs Datadumps][1] and
ingesting into various database systems,
[sqlite3](https://www.sqlite.org) and
[Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org).  The data is real world
recorded music data (supports [discogs.com](https://discogs.com),
quite longitudinal (spanning 16 years as of 2024), updated monthly,
and of course a bit messy.
